    <h4>This is a simple and delicious vegan pancake recipe from 
        <a href="https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-pancakes/">Nora Cooks Vegan</a>.</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup soy milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.</li>
            <li>Pour the milk, water and oil into the bowl with the dry ingredients, and stir with a large spoon until just combined. A few lumps are okay; do not over mix or your pancakes won't be as fluffy.</li>
            <li>Heat a large griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Grease the pan with vegan butter or coconut oil, and drop about 1/3 cup of the batter onto it. Cook until bubbles form, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 1-2 minutes. Repeat with all the remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Serve with vegan butter, pure maple syrup and perhaps some fresh fruit.</li>
    </ol>
