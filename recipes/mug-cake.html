    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp canola oil</li>
        <li>3 tbsp non-dairy milk</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tbsp dairy-free chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, salt and baking powder to a mug. Stir or whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour in the oil, non-dairy milk and vanilla into the mug with the dry ingredients and stir well with a spoon. Sprinkle the chocolate chips on top.</li>
        <li>Cook in the microwave for 40 seconds. It will likely be a little undercooked in the middle at this point, which is my preference, but if you want it cooked more, microwave it another 10-20 seconds.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately. </li>
    </ol>
